# For code quality

For code quality, we use pre-commit. To install it, run the following command:

```sh
pip install pre-commit
```

For new projects or every time you change the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file, you need to run the following command:

```sh
pre-commit install # This will install the pre-commit hooks in your .git/hooks folder
```

Every time you will commit something, the pre-commit hooks will run. If you want to run them manually, you can run the following command:

```sh
pre-commit run --all-files
```

```sh
cd docs
